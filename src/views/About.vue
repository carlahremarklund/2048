    <h1>The Game of 2048</h1>
    <p style="padding-top: 4rem; width: 36rem; text-align: center">
      2048 is a game where you combine numbered tiles in order to gain a higher
      numbered tile. In this game you start with two tiles, the lowest possible
      number available is two. Then you will play by combining the tiles with
      the same number to have a tile with the sum of the number on the two
      tiles. <br> <br>
      A lot of strategies have been devised in order to obtain the 2048
      and be a winner in this game. But others have strived for a greater
      height. Which is a score beyond 2048. After. <br><br>
      The game of 2048 does not include complicated controls.
      The controls youâ€™ll be using are
      just upward, downward, and sideways. <br><br>

      When playing on a computer you control the tiles by pressing
      up, down, left or right. <br><br>

      If you are playing on a mobile device just swipe your finger in the
      direction you want to move the tiles.<br><br>
      The rules are also simple. <br>
      You just need to move the tiles and every time you move one, another tile
      pops up in a random manner anywhere in the box. When two tiles with
      the same number on them collide with one another as you move them,
      they will merge into one tile with the sum of the numbers
      written on them initially.
